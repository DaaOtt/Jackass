Jackass
=======

Garry's Mod gamemode. It's like Skate 3, but without the Skate.

Installing
==========

1. [Download](https://github.com/DaaOtt/Jackass/archive/master.zip) the repository.
2. Drag `Jackass-master` into your gamemodes folder
3. **Rename `Jackass-master` to `jackass`**


Burnout
=======

I got burnt out on this gamemode. Here's some stuff that I started but didn't finish:
* Combos
  * The base system is there, but the only combos you can get are for breaking props and all it is is a list with no animations whatsoever. Need to have more things that start combos and make that list juicy!
* Rope Gun
  * It works, but the way I disabled it during ragdoll mode is really hacky. It basically just switches you away from that weapon. Nothing to stop you from switching back.
* Camera
  * The camera was meant to be similar to Sandbox's camera tool, but limited to a tripod. You'd get bonus points for snapping pictures of your body getting hurt.
